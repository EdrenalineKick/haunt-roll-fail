    * network error to Fetch.
    *

    * the Response body, not URLs. If the request is a top-level navigation and the return value is a Response whose
    * type attribute is opaque (i.e. an opaque response body), a network error is returned to Fetch. The final URL of
    * all successful (non network-error) responses is the requested URL.
