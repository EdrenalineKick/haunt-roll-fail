  /** The async and defer attributes are boolean attributes that indicate how the script should be executed. The defer
    * and async attributes must not be specified if the src attribute is not present. There are three possible modes
    * that can be selected using these attributes. If the async attribute is present, then the script will be executed
    * asynchronously, as soon as it is available. If the async attribute is not present but the defer attribute is
    * present, then the script is executed when the page has finished parsing. If neither attribute is present, then the
    * script is fetched and executed immediately, before the user agent continues parsing the page. Note: The exact
    * processing details for these attributes are, for mostly historical reasons, somewhat non-trivial, involving a
    * number of aspects of HTML. The implementation requirements are therefore by necessity scattered throughout the
    * specification. These algorithms describe the core of this processing, but these algorithms reference and are
    * referenced by the parsing rules for &lt;script&gt;Â start and end tags in HTML, in foreign content, and in XML, the
    * rules for the document.write() method, the handling of scripting, etc. The defer attribute may be specified even
    * if the async attribute is specified, to cause legacy Web browsers that only support defer (and not async) to fall
    * back to the defer behavior instead of the synchronous blocking behavior that is the default.
